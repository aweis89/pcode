"""Tell the model which MCP servers are enabled without rewriting its prompt.

Tool search hides deferred MCP tools, so nothing in a request says a server
exists until the model thinks to search, and a model that does not know gdrive
is enabled reaches for `gcloud` instead. The fix has two halves. A fixed
instruction says where the list is; it names no server, so it never changes
during a session. The list itself is appended to history, and only when it
differs from the last one there, so enabling a server mid-conversation leaves
earlier messages (and the provider's cached prefix) untouched. The same check
restores the list after compaction drops it.
