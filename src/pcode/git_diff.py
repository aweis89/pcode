"""Net git diffs for /diffs: what a session's work adds up to, one entry per file.

A linked worktree belongs to its session, so its whole branch is compared with
the merge-base on the mainline branch. That is exactly what a merge would bring
in, and it stays right after `/worktree merge` merges mainline into the branch,
where a remembered starting commit would claim mainline's changes too. A shared
checkout has no branch of its own, so it compares the working tree with the
commit the session started from, but only for files this session's tools edited
or its commits touched, since anything else there may be the user's. A commit
counts as the session's when it is new since the start, was made after the
session began, and by this checkout's git identity; a pulled commit is neither.
The same load also cuts out what is not yet committed, and what changed since
the tree last marked reviewed, kept under the session's refs (`SESSION_REFS`)
with the tree it was compared against.

`git diff` never shows untracked files, and staging them would change the
user's index. So the working tree is recorded into a throwaway copy of the index
(`GIT_INDEX_FILE`), written out as a tree, and diffed tree to tree; the real
index is never written. The copy sits beside the real one because a split index
finds its shared half there. Untracked files that look sensitive are listed but
never hashed, so their contents do not reach the object store.
