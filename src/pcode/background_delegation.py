"""Let a steering message reach the parent while its delegate keeps working.

A foreground `delegate_task` holds the parent's tool call until the child
finishes, and steering only rides the next model request, so a message sent
mid-delegation used to wait out the whole child. `shell` solves the same problem
by handing its wait back as a job handle; this does it for delegation.

The call starts its child as a task in Harness's `BackgroundTools` task group and
waits on it as before. If the user steers first, the call returns now, the child
carries on, and its result is enqueued for a later request. Harness then keeps
the run alive until every detached child has reported: the model can answer the
user, do other work, or end its response and be woken by the result.

Reaches into `BackgroundTools`' private task group, outcome stream and live
count; `tests/test_background_delegation.py` pins them.
