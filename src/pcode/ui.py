    With ``atomic`` the handoff is wrapped in synchronized output and, when the
    body reports how many rows it wrote (``Handoff.rows_written``), the editor
    is repainted immediately from the computed cursor row instead of after a
    cursor position report. The whole erase, write, and repaint then reach the
    terminal as one frame with no await in between, so the editor and live
    panel never visibly disappear. A report is still requested and lands
    before the next handoff; the renderer's cursor bookkeeping is relative, so
    a miscount (Rich and the terminal disagreeing on a glyph's width) only
    misjudges the free rows below the editor until that reply corrects it,
    exactly as prompt_toolkit tolerates a layout taller than its report.
    Popups and external programs must not use ``atomic``: a frame held across
    them would freeze the terminal until its guard timeout.

    An atomic handoff also keeps the terminal in raw mode. Only an external
    program needs cooked mode, and in cooked mode the tty echoes anything typed
    during the handoff and turns a Return into a newline, which the editor then
    reads as Ctrl+J. Paced scrollback makes handoffs frequent while the user
    may well be typing, so the window has to be harmless.

    This mirrors prompt_toolkit's ``in_terminal``, except for when the editor
    is painted again. ``in_terminal`` repaints immediately after the handoff,
    before the cursor position report it has just requested arrives, so that
    paint knows nothing about the space below the cursor and lands the editor
    at its preferred height, directly under the new output. The report then
    re-renders the layout across the remaining screen ~1/30 s later (bounded
    by ``min_redraw_interval``), which moves the editor back to the bottom.
    Whenever the transcript leaves rows free below it (startup, the first tool
    calls of a session) every write makes the editor visibly jump up and back.
    Waiting for the report first paints the editor at its final position.

    To check for a regression, do not trust ``tmux capture-pane``: it shows only
    the settled frame and cannot see two paints inside one redraw interval.
    Record the raw byte stream with timestamps instead
    (``tmux pipe-pane -o 'python3 stamp.py >> out.bin'``) and look for a second
    editor paint after a scrollback write.
