"""Repair a history whose native-tool results the current login cannot read.

Anthropic returns each server-side `web_search` hit as an opaque
`encrypted_content` blob that only the organization it was issued to can
decrypt. Replay is therefore credential-bound: sign in as a different account
-- a second `/login`, another `PCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, an API key in place of a
subscription -- and the request comes back as
`400 Invalid encrypted_content in search_result block`. The blobs live in the
message history, so without a repair every later request in that session fails
the same way and the conversation is stranded.

Dropping them is the whole repair. The page text inside a blob is unrecoverable,
but the titles and URLs beside it are plaintext, and the model's own reading of
the search sits in the same response. Thinking signatures cross accounts
untouched (verified against the live endpoint), so they are left alone.
