"""Log event-loop stalls in the terminal: the moments typed keys wait to be read.

Keystrokes and model output share one asyncio loop. When synchronous work holds
it, keys queue in the tty and land together once it frees, so typing seems to
freeze and then a whole word pops up. A heartbeat task notes when the loop last
ran; a watcher thread samples the loop thread's stack while the heartbeat is
overdue and appends one JSON line per stall to `stalls.jsonl` in the state
directory. A freeze with no stall logged at that time means the loop was free
and the terminal itself held the frame back.

A stall that holds the GIL throughout (garbage collection, one long C call)
leaves the watcher no chance to sample, so it is logged from the late heartbeat
alone, with no stacks; `gc_ms` says how much of it was collection.

Records hold file names, line numbers, and function names, never arguments or
locals, as `pcode.profiling` does.
