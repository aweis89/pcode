"""The shell tool, expressed as jobs: one way to run, two ways to wait.

Harness's persistent `shell` launches every command detached and differs only
in whether the call blocks, which is the right shape. What it lacks is a name
for the thing that outlives the call. Without one, a command that is still
running can only be handed back as a PID and two paths, so the model's only way
to learn it finished is to poll with `sleep`, an interrupted wait kills the
command, and nothing can list what a session left running.

This toolset keeps the execution model and adds the missing noun. `shell`
returns either a finished result or a job handle; `wait_for_job` blocks on a
handle without re-running anything; completions are delivered by
`pcode.job_notices` at the next model request. Polling from the model is
therefore never the right move, and the instructions say so.
