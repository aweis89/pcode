"""Mutation evidence layered on Harness's filesystem operations.

Harness announces each write and edit through `_request` while it holds the
file's lock and before it writes, so the before snapshot is taken there, inside
the operation rather than from a later reread. The after side is what the write
put there: the written content, or the same replacements applied to the snapshot.
