    This is the state that must never be shared between two turns: each field
    describes one branch at one moment, so a second turn writing into it would
    not race so much as quietly answer with the wrong conversation. Holding it
    in one object means a turn can be handed its own, and the per-run
    capabilities can bind to *that* turn rather than to the runtime.

    The runtime keeps one of these for the active branch and exposes its fields
    under their original names, so callers that ask a runtime for `history` or
    `plan_store` still get the branch they are looking at.
