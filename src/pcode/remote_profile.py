"""The fixed execution profile for a session host nobody is watching.

A host started by a remote control (`pcode --email-listen`) runs turns with no
one at the terminal to stop them, and pcode has no approval step. So the
listener chooses a profile locally, before any message arrives, and nothing
sent remotely can change it:

- the bundled `sandbox` extension is on whatever `extensions_off` says, its
  shell sandbox cannot be switched off, and it also refuses reads of the
  listener's own state and credentials, and keychain lookups from the shell;
- the host's environment is built from an allowlist, not inherited whole;
- MCP servers stay off unless the profile opts in (they run unsandboxed);
- each turn has a wall-clock limit and a budget of model requests and tool
  calls, shared with its sub-agents; reaching one ends the turn with a status
  that says so;
- the session always gets a fresh worktree, which is kept when the host stops.

`spawn_host(profile=...)` hands the profile to `pcode.host`, which calls
`activate` before anything else is built; the rest of pcode asks `active()`.
