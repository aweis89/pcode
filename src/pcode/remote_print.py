"""`pcode --attach HOST --print PROMPT`: one message or command for a running host, no editor.

It attaches like a terminal, sends the message (queued behind whatever the host
is already doing) or the slash command, writes what that produces the way a
local `--print` writes its turn (the reply on stdout, the rest on stderr), and
detaches. The host keeps running, and every other terminal sees the turn too.

The host tells this caller alone when its message's turn starts, or that it
was dropped, in order with everything else it shows (`pcode.host._Owner`), so
a turn another terminal started, or one already running, is never mistaken
for it. Notes other terminals cause while it runs are written all the same.
