"""Throwaway git worktrees, one per session, so concurrent sessions never share a tree.

The workspace *is* the worktree: file tools, the shell, repo context, and the
saved session all point at it, so the model needs no instructions and relative
paths cannot land in the mainline checkout by mistake.

Setup that git cannot do (installing dependencies, copying untracked config,
symlinking shared caches) lives in two optional scripts run after checkout:
`~/.config/pcode/worktree-setup` for every repo, then `<repo>/.pcode/worktree-setup`
for this one. The project script is arbitrary code shipped with the repo, so it
only runs for a trusted repository, like `.pcode/extensions`.
