"""Conversation ids for runs on a model other than the conversation's.

Meridian keys its session on the conversation id, so a request from another
model under the conversation's id would move that session and force the
conversation's next turn to replay cold. A run on another model (`/btw $MODEL`,
a `$MODEL` prompt) carries an id of its own, derived from the conversation's so
anything that needs the session it belongs to can still find it.
