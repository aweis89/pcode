"""Every model pcode can build pairs native tool search with a way to defer schemas.

A profile that offers `ToolSearchTool` without a `tool_deferral_mode` puts the
search on the wire and withholds every deferred tool instead of declaring it.
OpenAI answers `400 tools.tool_search requires at least one deferred tool`, and
since MCP servers are deferred by default, that fails every request of any
session with a server enabled. The per-provider profiles drift independently
across upgrades, so check the pairing for every buildable model at once rather
than trusting whichever provider happened to be fixed last.
