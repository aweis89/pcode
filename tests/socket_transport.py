"""Run the app-level tests with the session in a host, over a real socket.

`pytest --transport socket` (or `PCODE_TEST_TRANSPORT=socket`) makes every
`PreviewApp` that would run its session in-process run it in a `SessionHost`
in the same event loop instead, and attach to that host the way a terminal
attaches to a spawned one: `HostLaunch`, the welcome, then intents and view
calls over the socket. The test drives the terminal exactly as before, so the
same assertions check the hosted path.

Tests that look inside the in-process controller, or at what only a local
session prints, are marked `in_process` and skipped under this transport.
