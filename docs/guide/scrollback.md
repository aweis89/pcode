# Scrollback and transparency

pcode doesn't take over your screen. Replies, diffs and command output go into
your terminal's normal scrollback, and only the editor and a small activity
panel at the bottom redraw. Everything you already do in a terminal keeps
working: scroll with the mouse or tmux copy mode, find with your terminal's
search, select and copy.

## Choose what's in scrollback, then change your mind

pcode keeps the transcript it wrote, so it can rewrite your scrollback when you
change what you want to see. A toggle doesn't just affect what comes next: the
history already on screen is rebuilt to match.

A typical rhythm:

1. While a tricky turn runs, press **Ctrl+G** to mirror every shell command and
   its output into scrollback, so you can watch the tests fail and pass.
2. Once it's done, press Ctrl+G again. The same history comes back with the
   command output gone and each run of tool calls folded into one line, so the
   reply is easy to find:

    ```text
    ✓ 15 ✗ 1 tools · Edit file ✓10 · Run shell ✓5 ✗1
    ```

3. Want a line per call instead? `/group-tools off` unfolds them, again for the
   whole history.

The toggles, each saved as your default:

| Toggle | Shows or hides |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+G, `/show-commands` | Each shell command and its output |
| `/show-edits` | The diff of each file edit |
| `/show-thinking` | The model's readable reasoning |
| `/group-tools` | One line per run of tool calls (the default) or one per call |
| Ctrl+O, `/show-tasks` | The live task and tool panel above the editor |

Hidden isn't deleted. Thinking, diffs and command results are kept even while
hidden, including in resumed sessions, so turning a toggle on later shows them
for the whole conversation. Rebuilding never reruns a tool.

The same rebuild runs when you resize the terminal, so narrowing a pane doesn't
leave half-wrapped copies of the old layout behind, and `/redraw` does it on
demand. One thing to know: a rebuild clears the terminal's scrollback first,
including anything from before pcode started, then writes pcode's transcript
back. See [the transcript](../transcript.md) for limits and settings.

## Every command, nothing hidden: `/tools`

Summaries in scrollback are for skimming. When you want the full story,
`/tools` lists every tool call in the conversation, newest first, and works
while a turn is still running:

- the exact command or arguments, formatted for reading
- whether the model waited on it or ran it in the background
- how long it took and whether it failed
- the complete output the model got back

Type to search, press Ctrl+X to show only failures, and Ctrl+T to filter by
tool. Ctrl+Y copies the command so you can run it yourself, and Ctrl+O copies
the output. It works on resumed sessions too, so you can audit what an agent
did last week. Opening it never reruns anything. See the
[tool-call inspector](../commands.md#tool-call-inspector).

## Review the changes: `/diffs`

`/diffs` shows the session's work as a git diff, one entry per file, in a
full-screen browser. It's the quickest way to review what changed before you
commit or merge. See the [diff browser](../commands.md#diff-browser).
