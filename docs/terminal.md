# Terminal setup

pcode draws inside your terminal, but two things it reports land outside the
screen, in places your terminal owns: the session's name goes in the **tab and
pane titles**, and a running turn shows as a **progress bar** on the tab or
split. Run a few sessions side by side and those two signals tell you, without
switching, what each one is doing and whether it's still working.

How they look (where the title shows, how wide a tab gets, how thick and what
colour the bar is) is up to the terminal, so most of the tuning happens in its
settings rather than pcode's. This page covers what pcode sends, then the
settings worth changing in [iTerm2](#iterm2) and [tmux](#tmux).

## Tab and pane titles

Once a session has a name, from `/rename` or the
[title its model gave it](sessions.md#session-titles), pcode puts it in the
terminal's tab title, so a row of tabs reads as a list of tasks. It follows
`/rename`, `/new` and `/switch`. A session with no name yet leaves the title to
your shell, and on exit pcode puts back the title it found, in terminals that
keep a title stack (xterm, iTerm2, kitty, Ghostty and VTE terminals such as
GNOME Terminal, among others). Elsewhere the title stays until your shell's
prompt sets its own. `pcode config set terminal_title off` leaves the title
alone; like the progress bar setting, it is read when pcode starts.

The title belongs to the split pcode runs in. Ghostty and kitty show the
focused split's title on the tab; [iTerm2](#iterm2) and [tmux](#tmux) can also
give every split its own title bar, so each pane carries its session's name.

## Progress bar

While a turn runs, pcode reports progress to the terminal itself (OSC 9;4),
which draws it outside the screen: Ghostty and kitty as a thin bar along the
top of the split, iTerm2 in the pane's top margin (or, from 3.7, as a ring
around each tab while the tab bar shows), Windows Terminal in the
tab, WezTerm wherever its
Lua config puts it. A busy tab is visible from the others.

| Bar | Means |
| --- | --- |
| Moving, no fill | A turn is running |
| Filling | A turn is running with a plan; the fill is how much of the plan is done |
| Paused (orange in Ghostty) | A failed provider request is being retried |
| Error (red in Ghostty) | The last turn failed; any key in that terminal, or the next turn, clears it |

The fill is weighted by step size. The model can mark a step S, M or L, so
one big implementation step counts for more than a quick check beside it.
Unmarked steps count as M. The running step counts as half done, so the bar
moves as soon as work starts, and cancelled steps drop out of the total.

`--print` shows the bar too, from launch until it exits (with `--attach`, while
the host works on the message or on the turns queued ahead of it), and takes
it down on exit. It goes to stderr, or to stdout when only that is a terminal,
so a reply piped elsewhere still leaves the bar on the terminal. When neither
is a terminal, nothing is sent.

The protocol carries only a state and a percentage, so the colours and
thickness are the terminal's: Ghostty uses the macOS accent colour for a
running bar, kitty uses its `scrollbar_*` colours, and [iTerm2](#iterm2) lets
you pick both per profile. Hide it on the terminal's side with Ghostty's
`progress-style = false` or kitty's `progress_bar hidden`.

The `terminal_progress` setting decides who gets it. `auto` sends it only to
terminals whose environment variables say they draw
it: Ghostty, WezTerm, iTerm2 3.6.6 or newer, Windows Terminal, ConEmu, VS
Code, Warp, mintty, VTE 0.79 terminals (GNOME Terminal, Ptyxis) and Konsole
26.04. Older iTerm2 and kitty before 0.38 read the sequence as a desktop
notification, which is why an unknown terminal gets nothing. kitty is among
them because it reports no version; on kitty 0.47 or newer, set
`terminal_progress on`. `on` sends it to any terminal, and terminals that
do not know it ignore it. The setting is read when pcode starts.

## iTerm2

These are the settings that change how pcode looks in iTerm2. None of them are
needed; the defaults work, and these make the most of several sessions at once.

### Settings > Appearance

- Under **Panes**, turn on **Show per-pane title bar with split panes** to give
  every split its own title bar, so each pcode pane shows its session's name.
  Without it, only the tab shows a title, and only for the focused split.
- Under **Tabs**, **Stretch tabs to fill bar** (on by default) lets tabs grow to
  use the whole bar. With a handful of tabs that's room for a full session name
  rather than a truncated one. **Tab bar scrolls when tabs don't fit** (also on
  by default) keeps every tab, and its name, in the bar once you have more
  than fit.
- **Tab Bar Location** set to **Left** stacks tabs vertically, one name per
  row, which suits long session names better than a row of narrow tabs across
  the top.

### Settings > Profiles

- On the **General** tab, **Applications in terminal may change the title**
  must stay on (it is by default). With it off, iTerm2 ignores the session name
  pcode sends.
- On the **Session** tab (iTerm2 3.7 or newer), **Progress bar height** sets the
  bar's thickness in points (2 by default) and **Progress bar color scheme**
  picks Default, Rainbow, or a single colour.

In a Dynamic Profile the progress bar keys are `"Progress Bar Height"` and
`"Progress Bar Color Scheme"`, and both need `"Enable Progress Bars"`. iTerm2
3.6.6 draws the bar but has neither setting.

iTerm2's own *status bar* (Profiles > Session > Status bar enabled) is a
separate feature; pcode doesn't write to it.

## tmux

Inside tmux, pcode's name goes to the pane title (`#T`, or `#{pane_title}` in
formats). tmux 3.5 added `allow-set-title`, which is on by default; turning it
off makes tmux ignore the name. tmux shows nothing of the pane title until you
ask it to, and there are three places to put it:

```tmux
set -g set-titles on                          # outer terminal's tab title
set -g pane-border-status top                 # a title line above each pane
set -g automatic-rename-format '#{pane_title}' # window names in the status line
```

- `set-titles` (off by default) lets tmux set the outer terminal's tab title.
  The default `set-titles-string`, `#S:#I:#W - "#T"`, puts the active pane's
  title after the session, window index and window name; set it to `"#T"` for
  the name alone.
- `pane-border-status top` draws a status line on each pane's border. The
  default `pane-border-format` includes the pane title, so each session's name
  sits above its pane, much like iTerm2's per-pane title bars.
- By default a window is named after the command in its active pane, so the
  status line reads `python` or `pcode`. With `automatic-rename-format` set as
  above it shows the active pane's title instead. Panes running a shell show
  whatever title the shell sets, often the hostname, so you may prefer to
  scope this to one window with `set -w`. `allow-rename` is a different
  sequence that pcode doesn't send, so it has no effect here.

For the progress bar, the terminal is judged by what the tmux server's
environment inherited from the terminal it was started in (tmux replaces `TERM`
and `TERM_PROGRAM`). Turn on `allow-passthrough` (tmux 3.3 or newer, off by
default) so pcode can reach the outer terminal directly; it is the reliable way,
since Ghostty drops a report that is not refreshed within about 15 seconds and
pcode refreshes it every few. Without it, tmux 3.7 or newer forwards the
active pane's bar itself, but only when it changes, so a long turn's bar can
fade in Ghostty; older tmux drops it. Two pcode panes side by side share the
window's one bar, which shows whichever reported last.

```tmux
set -g allow-passthrough on
```
